## beta distribution 

[an example](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/27/bayesian-amazon/ "A Bayesian view of Amazon Resellers")

* A uniform distribution is the same as a Beta(1, 1) distribution.

* beta distributions that have large parameters can be **approximated by normal distributions** with the **same mean and variance**. (A beta(a, b) random variable has mean $a / (a + b)$ and variance $ab / ((a + b)^2 (a + b + 1))$.
